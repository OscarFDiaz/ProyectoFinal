I woke up pissed off today
And lately everyone feels fake
Somewhere I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down your 
pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only 
hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down your 
pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only 
hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow 
like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too
Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running, just to keep my 
hands on you

There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you
I'm running, running, just to keep my 
hands on you

Running, running, just to keep my 
hands on you

Running, running, just to keep my 
hands on you

So I'm running, running, just to keep my 
hands on you

But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too
