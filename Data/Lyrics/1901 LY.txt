Counting all different ideas, drifting away, 
Past and present they don't matter 
Now the future's sorted out. 
Watch her moving in elliptical patterns; 
Think it's not what you say; 
What you say is way too complicated. 
For a minute, though, I couldn't tell how to
 fall out. 

It's twenty seconds till the last call, 
Callin' hey hey hey hey hey hey 
Lie down you know it's easy, 
Like we did it through summer long. 

And I'll be anything you ask and more, 
Going hey, hey, hey, hey, 
It's not a miracle we needed, 
No I wouldn't let you think so. 

Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it... 
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it. 

Girlfriend, oh your girlfriend's drifting away, 
Past and present, 1855-1901. 
Watch them built up a material tower 
Think it's not gonna stay anyway 
I think it's overrated 
For a minute, though, I couldn't tell how to
fall out. 

It's twenty seconds till the last call, 
Callin' hey hey hey hey hey hey 
Lie down you know it's easy, 
Like we did it through summer long. 

And I'll be anything you ask and more, 
Going hey, hey, hey, hey, 
It's not a miracle we needed, 
No I wouldn't let you think so. 

Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it... 
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it. 

Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it... 
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it... 
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it... 
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
