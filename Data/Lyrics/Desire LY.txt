I must be tough
I must behave, I must keep fighting
Don't give it up
I want to keep us compromising

Open your arms and pray
To the truth that you're denying
Give in to the game
To the sense that you've been hiding

Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you
I want desire
'Cause your love only gets me abused

Only gets me abused

Only gets me abused

Give me that rush
I want to show you what you've been missing
Am I enough
To keep your other lovers hidden

Open your arms and pray
To the truth that you're denying
Give in to the game
To the sense that you've been hiding

Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you
I want desire
'Cause your love only gets me abused

Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose

Only gets me abused

Only gets me abused
