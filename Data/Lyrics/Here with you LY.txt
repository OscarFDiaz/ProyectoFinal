When I saw you for the first time
Days were running by
We were spinning high
I was lost in every message
Collecting all your different pieces
Felt like a secret
When I saw you for the second time
Pain slowly dries, love lost its pride
Be careful as you leave

And there's enough of giving and 
everybody hurts
And there's enough of giving and 
everybody hurts
And there's enough of giving and 
everybody hurts
And everybody hurts

When I知 here with you
When I知 here with you

When I知 here with you, I feel so 
confused
When I知 here with you, I
Enter the falling, I'm crawling back 
up
When I知 here with you, I

When I知 here with you
When I知 here with you
When I知 here with you
