I'm losing sleep
Light a smoke so I can breathe
It's too dark, it's too loud in the city
If I had a god, I would say he was wrong
Got these scars, but I think they're pretty

So I say hey!
Been high since yesterday
You know it kills the pain
It's hard to find a love through 
every shade of grey
So tired of the same
Never seems to change

It's hard to find a love through
every shade of grey
It's hard to find a love through 
every shade of grey
It's hard to find a love through 
every shade of grey

Hey!
Been high since yesterday
You know it kills the pain
It's hard to find a love through 
every shade of grey
So tired of the same
Never seems to change

It's hard to find a love through
every shade of grey
It's hard to find a love through 
every shade of grey
It's hard to find a love through 
every shade of grey

Hey!

It's hard to find a love through

Hey!
Been high since yesterday
It's hard to find a love through 
every shade, every shade

Hey!
Been high since yesterday
It's hard to find a love through 
every shade, every shade of grey (hey, hey, hey)
