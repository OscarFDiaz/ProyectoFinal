On a cobweb afternoon
in a room full of emptiness
by a freeway i confess
i was lost in the pages
of a book full of death
reading how we'll die alone
and if we're good we'll lay to rest
anywhere we want to go

[Chorus]

in your house i long to be
room by room patiently
i'll wait for you there
like a stone
i'll wait for you there
alone

On my deathbed i will pray
to the gods and the angels
like a pagan to anyone
who will take me to heaven
to a place i recall
i was there so long ago
the sky was bruised
the wine was bled
and there you led me on

[Chorus]

in your house i long to be
room by room patiently
i'll wait for you there
like a stone
i'll wait for you there
alone
alone

And on i read
until the day was gone
and i sat in regret
of all the things i've done
for all that i've blessed
and all that i've wronged
in dreams until my death
i will wander on

[Chorus]

in your house i long to be
room by room patiently
i'll wait for you there
like a stone
i'll wait for you there
alone
alone
