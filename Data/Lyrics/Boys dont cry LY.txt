I would say I'm sorry 
If I thought that it would change your mind 
But I know that this time 
I have said too much 
Been too unkind 

I try to laugh about it 
Cover it all up whit lies 
I try and laugh about it 
Hiding the tears in my eyes 
Because boys don't cry 
Boys don't cry 

I would break down at your feet 
And beg forgiveness 
Plead whit you 
But I know that it's too late 
And now there's nothing I can do 
So I try to laugh about it 
Hiding the tears in my eyes 
Because boys don't cry 
Boys don't cry 

I would tell you 
That I loved you 
If I thought that you would stay 
But I know that it's no use 
That you've already 
Gone away 

Misjudged your limit 
Pushed you too far 
Took you for granted 
I thought that you needed me more 

Now I would do most anything 
To get you back by my side 
But I just keep on laughing 
Hiding the tears in my eyes 
Because boys don't cry 
Boys don't cry 
Boys don't cry
