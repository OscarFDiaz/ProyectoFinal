I don't really say this that often
But there's something that the 
papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know
 I feed them but I know
They're painting but they can't 
leave a mark

'Cause my friends don't read the 
papers
And they don't really care if we're 
awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know 
I feed them But I know, 
They wanna see me hang on the 
Wall

You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, 
you owe me
If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, 
you owe me

Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losing, but I'm losing 
my mind
Does anybody know what that's like?

You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, 
you owe me

If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, 
you owe me

If I'm dead, you owe me
If I'm dead, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
If I'm dead, you owe me

Yeah, if I'm dead, you owe me
(If I'm dead, if I'm dead, If I'm dead, 
you owe me)

You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, 
you owe me

If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, 
you owe me
